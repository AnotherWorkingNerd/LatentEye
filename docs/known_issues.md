# known problems and issues
### Last update: Aug 31, 2025

if you have a png, jpeg image that doesn't display the image or metadata properly, please include it, if you can, in the bug report along with details of what was expected. It's hard to fix if I don't know what it should be.

These are the known problems. please do not file a bug for any of these issues.
- **Likely Fixed:**  I think what is in [Ubuntu Notes](./Ubuntu_notes.md). take care of the issue. Let me know if it is still an issue.
- **FIXED:** ~~EyeSight: zoom and fit to window do not work. This work is in progress.~~
- **FIXED:** ~~MainWindow: sorting does not work. This work is in progress.~~
- **FIXED:** ~~Some~~ A few menu options may not work as expected.

Working on:
- Linux: metadata font is too large.
- Linux: not all the directories should be shown, especially system level dirs.
- Linux: Volume/drive selection needs work better.
